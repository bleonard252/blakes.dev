# Why does the Bridge Tool exist?
Bridges are important to a growing ecosystem, and to the Fediverse's very design. They exist to bring everyone together. They're important to bringing back the diaspora of family and friends who have fled from Twitter to different platforms than you. They're important for following accounts from more advanced or simpler systems, like independent web sites or protocols. In short, bridges are how we connect to an even wider world.

## Why are centralized platforms not included?
These bridges don't work well and don't have the easy, automatic setup this service relies on. <!-- You can find these bridges listed here. -->

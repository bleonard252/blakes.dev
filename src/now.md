# "Now" Page
The Now page was [invented by Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff) and shows you [what I'm doing right now](https://nownownow.com/about), in a bigger-picture sort of way.

<!-- I'm not working on anything at the moment. -->

## ðŸ’¿ Listening to

* Metallica
  * I got some CDs for Christmas that I finally got around to ripping: Death Magnetic, Master of Puppets, and Hardwired...to Self Destruct (in addition to the Black Album, which I've had for a while).
* Project Vela, STARSET, Shinedown, and Breaking Benjamin, as usual

... wanna introduce me to some more indie rock bands? Good ones, like Project Vela.

## ðŸ“š Learning

**German language** &dash; with Babbel, on Beginner (A2) Course 2.

Why am I learning German, you ask? Several reasons.
1. It's fun to learn a language nobody\* else you know does. I can confuse the living hell out of people, and that's hilarious, by the way. I can also curse out people and they'll never know if I'm saying "your mom" or an elaborate curse. (German's absurdly long words help with that....)
2. I have at least one friend who would prefer speaking anything other than English. Understandably so, because English sucks. In my opinion it's pretty on par with how bad English sucks. For example, *numbers are backwards.* The number 41 is "einsundvierzig" (lit. one and fourty). Kinda ridiculous.
3. A secret third reason I am not yet prepared to tell or commit to. Just wait it out `;)`

## ðŸŽ® Playing

* Dead Cells. It's easy to pick up and put down which is great because I have a short attention span.
* Fortnite, for the same reason.
* Halo Infinite multiplayer, also for that reason (I don't have Xbox Live Gold so I can't play the other ones multiplayer).
* Minecraft, in theory...

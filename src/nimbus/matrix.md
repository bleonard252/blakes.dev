# Nimbus ❤️ Matrix
Nimbus uses Matrix, a federated chat protocol, to build its forums. This provides many advantages:
* There are already a whole lot of Matrix homeservers out there.
* People using something that isn't Nimbus can still interact with a Nimbus forum, even if it is a suboptimal experience.
* Users do not have to create yet another account to participate in the forums-- *especially* when your chat is already on Matrix!
* The backend work is already done.

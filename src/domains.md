# Domains I own
Some may be omitted for various reasons.
* [blakes.dev](https://blakes.dev/?hello=there&general=kenobi) -- my personal website, also email
* [blakeslabs.com](https://blakes.dev/blakes-labs/) -- used for masked email and experimental deployments
* [federation.quest](https://federation.quest) -- former home to a Glitch-soc (Mastodon) and Calckey instance, current home to a closed-registration XMPP provider
* [bleon.zip](https://bleon.zip) -- link shortener
* [misintelligence.xyz](https://misintelligence.xyz) -- blog and amateur journalism, maybe
* [fightingthe.foo](https://fightingthe.foo) -- you can get your own subdomain via [FreeDNS](https://freedns.afraid.org) (or at least that's the idea)!

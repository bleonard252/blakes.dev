# "Now" Page
The Now page was [invented by Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff) and shows you [what I'm doing right now](https://nownownow.com/about), in a bigger-picture sort of way.

## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Working on

**Bodacious** &dash; [GitHub][gh/bo], [Google Play Store][play/bo], [F-Droid][fd/bo]

[gh/bo]: https://github.com/bleonard252/bodacious
[play/bo]: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.u1024256.bodacious
[fd/bo]: https://f-droid.org/en/packages/xyz.u1024256.bodacious/

The tasks I'm most focused on for Bodacious are, in rough order of priority:
* Bug-hunting. This app is littered with bugs and I've GOT to hunt them down.
* The F-Droid release. (On hold, for now.)
* Finishing Search. It's been a few months since I touched this so I don't know why it hasn't been merged yet.
* Playlists. I'm thinking of going the standards-compliant route for this, but maybe the way to go is to store the playlist data in the database then later offer to export them into XML playlists.
* ~~Migrate id3 package to another one, which should make it faster~~ Done
* Put something on the home screen.

Later, larger priorities, which may come after some kind of break:
* Lyrics (.lrc) support.
* Dismissible queue items (swiping left or right).
* Reorderable queue items (drag and drop).
* Bodacious 1.0.

**Zenit UI for the Web** &dash; [GitHub][gh/z]

## üíø Listening to

* Project Vela
  * September: released a new EP, Elsewhere
  * Finally got to listen to it in late October or early November (do not remember exactly when), and you can [read my thoughts here](https://misintelligence.xyz/album-review-elsewhere/).
* Trans-Siberian Orchestra &dash; as of late November, for 'tis the season
* STARSET
  * Recently (October?) released Waiting on the Sky to Change featuring Breaking Benjamin, which has got to be the best, most powerful crossover of all time.
* Shinedown
  * Planet Zero. 'Nuff said.
* Breaking Benjamin

... wanna introduce me to some more indie rock bands? The good ones. I've found some pretty bad indie acts.

## üìö Learning

**German language** &dash; with Babbel, on Beginner (A2) Course 2.

Why am I learning German, you ask? Several reasons.
1. It's fun to learn a language nobody\* else you know does. I can confuse the living hell out of people, and that's hilarious, by the way. I can also curse out people and they'll never know if I'm saying "your mom" or an elaborate curse. (German's absurdly long words help with that....)
2. I have at least one friend who would prefer speaking anything other than English. Understandably so, because English sucks. In my opinion it's pretty on par with how bad English sucks. For example, *numbers are backwards.* The number 41 is "einsundvierzig" (lit. one and fourty). Kinda ridiculous.
3. A secret third reason I am not yet prepared to tell or commit to. Just wait it out `;)`

## üéÆ Playing

* Team Fortress 2.
* Halo campaigns, thanks to the Master Chief Collection.
* Halo Infinite (a little less recently).
* Stardew Valley, the only way I'll ever get anything remotely similar to a date.
* Terraria. I'm preparing to fight the Wall of Flesh. It's probably going to take a couple attempts.

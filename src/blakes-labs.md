# Blake's Labs at blakeslabs.com
The domain blakeslabs.com is intended for experimental or staging use. Testing and demo deployments may be found under this domain. I also have it set up as a personal email masking service through Fastmail.

Anything on this domain is subject to break or disappear, without notice, at any time.

For record keeping purposes, the following projects are set up at this domain:
* [Example project](https://example.blakeslabs.com) - [Source code](https://source.blakes.dev/null/example) (this is just a placeholder, this doesn't actually exist)
